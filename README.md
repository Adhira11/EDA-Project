# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The goal is to understand the structure of the data, identify patterns, visualize distributions, detect outliers, and uncover relationships between features. The script includes summary statistics, histograms, boxplots, correlation analysis, pairplots, and interactive visualizations. This analysis helps build a foundation for further data preprocessing, modeling, and decision-making.
